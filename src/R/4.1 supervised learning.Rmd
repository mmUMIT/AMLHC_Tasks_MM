# Supervised learning

## Load in data and investigate data


```{r}


setwd("C:/Users/m.vandermark/Desktop/studies/UMIT/Modul 12 - machine learning applications")
health_data <- read.csv("./AMLHC_Tasks_MM/src/Data/heartdata.csv", row.names = 1)

cor(health_data$biking, health_data$smoking)
plot(health_data$biking, health_data$smoking)
hist(health_data$biking)


```
```{r}


plot(heartdisease ~ biking, data = health_data)
plot(heartdisease ~ smoking, data = health_data)

```


## Linear regression

```{r}

health_lm <- lm(heartdisease ~ biking, data = health_data)

health_lm
summary(health_lm)

```
